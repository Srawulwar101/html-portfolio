<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Shreyas Rawulwar, and I am a student 
at the University of Texas at Austin pursuing a B.S. degree
in Electrical and Computer Engineering Honors. I am currently 
self-learning front-end development in an effort to improve 
my expertise and become a more valued candidate for internships,
and this portfolio is a basic project I've coded using only HTML.
Enjoy!</p>
